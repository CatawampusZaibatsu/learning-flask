## Description

This is a project I started to help me learn the ins and outs of the Flask library while also familiarizing myself with source control. I plan on pushing updates to GitHub as I progress through the tutorial. 

The tutorial I followed by Corey Schafer can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH&index=1).
